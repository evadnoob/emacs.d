Announcing EFS 1.16 and Dired 7.9
=================================

This is to announce the release of EFS 1.16, a system for transparent
file-transfer via ftp as well as Dired 7.9, a file manager that runs
within Emacs.

These are beta releases.

It has been several years since the release EFS 1.15.  Most of the
changes for 1.16 and 7.9 affect XEmacs support.  EFS has been part of
XEmacs since XEmacs 19.15, and there is little need for users of a
current version of XEmacs to install EFS 1.16 / Dired 7.9.

As a result, EFS 1.16 / Dired 7.9 has only been tested *very* lightly
under GNU Emacs for quite some time, and it is not clear how well it
currently works.  Compatibility wasn't ever knowingly affected, but as
these things go, your mileage may vary.  Hopefully, some knowledgeable
users of GNU Emacs will give it a whirl and report problems and/or
fixes for them back to the EFS lists.

Other user-visible changes:

- There is now Texinfo documentation for EFS.

- User customization works via Per Abrahamsen's custom package.

- EFS supports various ftp servers running under Windows NT.

- Lots (and lots) of bug fixes.

- Dired has been split off from the main EFS package; it is required
  for running EFS.
